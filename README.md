# Welcome to Keno's core! 
This repository holds Keno's behaviour engine (script) and other main aspects of Keno. This repository allows you to make Keno in the way that you imagine him :)

Eventually this will also host his animations, but at the moment only holds his primary scripts. These scripts are what gives Keno his personality, functionality, and everything of that nature.

## Key Info
Keno is made in `Unity` and coded in `C#` (c sharp). His animations can be any video file attached to a `VideoPlayer` inside of a Unity `GameObject`
Keno is a huge WIP and is no where near being perfect. Anyone optimizing the code or improving upon it (such as fixing it, or adding new features, etc) is greatly appreciated
